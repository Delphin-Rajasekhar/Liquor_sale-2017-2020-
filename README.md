In 2017, sales commenced at an average level, followed by a significant decline in 2018. However, in 2019, sales rebounded impressively, reaching their peak. Overall, 2019 recorded the highest sales figures across the years analyzed. 

Conversely, in 2020, sales experienced a notable decrease. This alternating pattern of increase and decrease every other year warrants further investigation to understand the underlying factors driving these fluctuations. Analyzing the causes behind these rises and falls is crucial for devising strategies to mitigate downturns and capitalize on periods of growth.

Every year consistently sees wine, beer, and liquor occupying the top three spots in sales, with minimal differences between them. The leading spot alternates between wine, beer, and liquor, demonstrating their competitive edge. 

In contrast, kegs, non-alcoholic beverages, and dunnage consistently show the lowest sales figures throughout each month across the years 2017-2020. 

This trend underscores the enduring popularity of wine, beer, and liquor, while also highlighting areas for potential improvement or strategic focus in the sales of kegs, non-alcoholic beverages, and dunnage.
